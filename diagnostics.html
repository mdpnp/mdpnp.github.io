    <h1>OpenICE System Diagnostics</h1>
    <p class="description">
      This page shows current realtime data values from the OpenICE system.It is meant to surface available data for diagnostic and testing purposes while other, more advanced UIs, UXs, and apps are developed to represent and interact with this data model in more meaningful ways.  Descriptions of each data topic have also been included.
    </p>
    <div class="description">
      Note:
      <ul>
        <li>For convenience Unique Device Identifiers (UDIs) have been replaced on this page with Make/Model for a device when it is available from the DeviceIdentity topic.</li>
        <li>Timestamps are presented in the timezone of the lab in Cambridge, MA for convenience though they are transported by the OpenICE system in Universal Time Coordinates.</li>

    <h2>Status:&nbsp;<span class="status"></span></h2>
    <p class="description">"Status" (also in the upper right) indicates whether this page is currently connected to the OpenICE web gateway.  The OpenICE web gateway is a <a href="https://nodejs.org">node.js</a> server program that uses an MD PnP DDS add-on for node.js to retrieve DDS information and share it over the web.  It utilizes <a href="http://socket.io">socket.io</a> for connectivity between client and server.</p>

    <p class="description">Each 'ICE' represents a logical partition of the greater system.  In this way a patient ICE can transcend physical network topology.  A portable device accompanying an ambulatory patient connected via a wifi network can still be in the same logical partition as the devices in that patient's room attached to a physical ethernet network.  And an app running in that partition will receive data from both devices.  Thus a singular 'ICE' defined by logical partition obviates a lot of issues with patient transport, ambulatory, and room preparation scenarios.  Our first candidate for a partitioning scheme is this one partition per-patient paradigm.  But options abound for other partitions existing in parallel perhaps for device type, assigned unit, etc.  This dropdown box collects all the partitions for all available data and allows this page to "tune into" one patient partition in particular.  Currently in the lab several patient 'environments' are configured with their own name.  The "name" used here is queried from our <a href="https://fhir.openice.info" target="_blank">FHIR Test Server</a></p>
